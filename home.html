    <h2 class="w3-wide">GOALS</h2>
    <p class="w3-justify">I built this React App which is a shopping website for clothes of types: shirts, bottoms, and dress, which can be worn to party, work or casually.
These clothes can be filtered by the user according to the two attributes mentioned: type and occassion. Further, since each of these clothing items has a price, the user can also use the sorting feature
to sort these clothes by price (either high to low, or low to high.) Each item has the option to be added to the user's shopping cart, which can be seen on the right side of the screen. Once added, the shopping cart
can show you: <ul>
  <li><p class="w3-justify">what items it contains and their price and quantity</li></p>
  <li><p class="w3-justify">how many items it contains </li></p>
  <li><p class="w3-justify">the total price of all the items in the cart.</li></p></ul></p>
<p class="w3-justify">This app focuses on getting right the three functionalities mentioned above: filtering, sorting and totalling the price of items in cart. Further, it ensures that the filtering and sorting
can be mixed and matched, and no amount of adding to cart or removing from cart breaks the app, and the total price of cart is always adjusted accordingly. The app is meant to give the user a seamless shopping experience in a simple, intuitive and minimalistic fashion.</p>

    <h2 class="w3-wide">USABILITY PRINCIPLES</h2>
    <p class="w3-justify">I worked hard to meet the design principles taught in class so far. These relate to each button and component in the app speaking for its functionality in itself, such that the user
    is able to interact with the app intuitively. I try to maintain spacing between components, and separate each elemtent from the other using borders. I maintain a consistent color and font scheme throughout. </p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Overall, I strive to maintain: <ul>
      <li><p class="w3-justify">A clear and minimalistic user interface, which is recallable from other shopping websites.</li></p>
      <li><p class="w3-justify">Each button and element being able to convey its functionality easily to the user.</li></p>
      <li><p class="w3-justify">Giving users full control and comfort in navigating the app.</li></p>
      <li><p class="w3-justify">Getting rid of any extraneous or confusing features and focusing on the primary actions.</li></p>
      <li><p class="w3-justify">Maintaining seamlessness by placing the relevant buttons in relevant places. For example: add button under item in product list, remove button next to item in cart, checkout button at the bottom of cart.</li></p>
      <li><p class="w3-justify">Consistency in design, layout and colour.</li></p>
      <li><p class="w3-justify">The balance between proximity, similarity, continuity and closure between components.</li></p>
